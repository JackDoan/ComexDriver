We're going to need some sort of differential line reciever to decode the encoder's signals. Buy or build?
	Needs to determine if A+ < or > A-
	ordered samples from Maxim to cover it foe now (5/25/15) (RS422 recievers)
	

eQEP Docs: http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spru790d/spru790d.pdf

Notice how the eQEP example is just an ISR. This makes it trivial to have it almost seamlessly update 
a value in memory, and the rest of the program can continue, blissfully unaware of what's happening.

"Phase Error Flag— In normal operating conditions, quadrature inputs QEPA and QEPB will be 90
degrees out of phase. The phase error flag (PHE) is set in the QFLG register when edge transition
is detected simultaneously on the QEPA and QEPB signals to optionally generate interrupts. State
transitions marked by dashed lines in Figure 6 are invalid transitions that generate a phase error."
** write code to handle this interrupt. shut down motor & write to console / blink LED
